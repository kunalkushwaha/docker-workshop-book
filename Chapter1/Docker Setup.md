At end of successful installation, you should be able to run following command successfully.

   ```
   $ docker run hello-world
   To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
   1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
   2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
   3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
     executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
   4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
     to your terminal.
   ```
